        Shiny green slices of jalapeño pepper adorn a plate of nachos. Chomping
        into one of those innocent-looking chilies will make a person’s mouth
        explode with spicy fireworks. Some people dread and avoid the painful,
        eye-watering, mouth-searing sensation. Others love the burn. “A quarter
        of the world’s population eats chilies every day,” notes Joshua
        Tewksbury. He is a biologist who spent 10 years studying wild chili
        peppers. He also happens to enjoy eating hot, spicy food. Chili peppers
        do much more than burn people’s mouths. Scientists have discovered many
        uses for the chemical that gives these veggies their zing. Called
        capsaicin (Kap-SAY-ih-sin), it’s the main ingredient in pepper spray.
        Some people use this weapon for self-defense. The spray’s high levels of
        capsaicin will burn the eyes and throats of attackers — but won’t kill
        people. In smaller doses, capsaicin can relieve pain, help with weight
        loss and possibly affect microbes in the gut to keep people healthier.
        Now how cool is that?
